## ðŸ§  About Me
Welcome to project portfolio! I'm Lormel Bationo, a recent graduate from Western Washington University with a Bachelor of Science in Statistics.

I am always eager to learn, explore new ideas, and connect with others across various disciplines whether you're working in public health, sport,  environmental science, business, or statistical studies.
I am proficient in analytical tools like Minitab, R, Python and SQL.
I am currently enrolleds in online courses on Udemy on SQL, PowerBi well as Excell for data analysis.

I am open to collaboration and welcome any feedback on my work. I genuinely welcome constructive feedback and see it as a valuable opportunity to grow both personally and professionally. 

Feel free to reach out if you're interested in working together or simply want to discuss data, methods, or insights I would like to work on as many projects and use tools like SQL, Powerbi and Excell!




# ðŸ“Š Statistics & Data Science Portfolio
This portfolio showcases a selection of my academic and independent data analysis projects. Each project demonstrates core statistical skills, programming techniques,
and real-world application of data science principles.


### 1. **Forecasting Global Warming Trends**
- **Techniques:** ARMA models, Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA)
- **Tools:** R
- **Summary:** Forecasted global temperature anomalies using NOAA data. Evaluated model performance using RMSE and the Diebold-Mariano test to compare predictive accuracy between methods.

### 2. **Paper Helicopter Flight Time Optimization**
- **Design:** Randomized block experiment with 2Â² factorial design
- **Summary:** Analyzed the impact of wing dimensions on paper helicopter flight time while controlling for environmental variability to identify the optimal configuration.

### 3. **Monte Carlo Simulation on Odds Ratio Confidence Intervals**
- **Simulation:** 10,000 trials across 2,352 parameter sets
- **Summary:** Evaluated the reliability and small-sample performance of Woolfâ€™s, Gartâ€™s, and Agrestiâ€™s odds ratio confidence intervals, including Welchâ€™s correction.

### 4. **Efficiency of Healthcare Systems During COVID-19**
- **Method:** Non-parametric analysis using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA)
- **Summary:** Assessed the relative efficiency of 13 countriesâ€™ healthcare systems in handling the COVID-19 pandemic, based on published performance metrics.

### 5. **Medical Insurance Premium Prediction**
- **Techniques:** Best subset selection, linear regression, regression trees
- **Summary:** Analyzed a dataset of 1,000 insurance customers to identify key factors influencing premium costs and build predictive models for pricing analysis.



## ðŸ§ª Work in Progress
 
### 1. **Fraud Detection in Financial Transactions**  
Designing a machine learning model to detect suspicious activity in financial transaction data using techniques like Isolation Forest, Logistic Regression, and Autoencoders.
This project involves working with imbalanced data, performance metrics beyond accuracy (e.g., precision, recall, AUC), and real-time anomaly detection strategies.

### 2. **Financial Analysis & Algorithmic Trading**  
Currently building an algorithmic trading system using Python, the OANDA API, and web scraping tools. The project focuses on collecting real-time financial data using Postman and JSON, applying technical indicators, and backtesting trading strategies. This hands-on approach to automated trading combines financial analysis, scripting, and performance evaluation under live market conditions.


### 3. **Analyzing Customer Shopping Habits**  
Developing models to uncover patterns in customer shopping behavior using clustering (K-Means, DBSCAN), market basket analysis, and predictive models (Random Forest, XGBoost). The goal is to segment customers, identify frequently purchased product combinations, and forecast future purchases. I am planning to add to my report some valuable targeted marketing recommendations.

### 4. **Enhancing Climate Forecast Models**  
Building upon my previous work forecasting global temperature anomalies using ARMA and SSA. To improve predictive accuracy and interpretability, I am incorporating external
explanatory variables such as COâ‚‚ levels, solar radiation, distance from the sea, latitude nd volcanic using regression with ARMA errors (ARIMA). This extension will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the drivers behind global warming.

### 5. **Deep Learning Exploration**  
I recently invested in an NVIDIA graphics card to enable GPU-accelerated computing, and I am currently diving into deep learning. My focus is on building foundational skills 
in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for time-series forecasting. Projects will explore applications in computer vision, medical diagnostics, and natural language processing. With improved computing capacity I am also planning to  rework on the study about Odds ratio conbfidence interval by using 100,000 trials instead of 10,000.
