## ðŸ§  About Me
Welcome to project portfolio! I'm Lormel Bationo, a recent graduate from Western Washington University with a Bachelor of Science in Statistics.
I'm always eager to learn, explore new ideas, and connect with others across disciplines. Whether you're working in public health, environmental science, business, or beyond 
â€” Iâ€™m open to collaboration and welcome any feedback on my work.  

Feel free to reach out if you're interested in working together or simply want to discuss data, methods, or insights!




# ðŸ“Š Statistics & Data Science Portfolio
This portfolio showcases a selection of my academic and independent data analysis projects. Each project demonstrates core statistical skills, programming techniques,
and real-world application of data science principles.


### 1. **Forecasting Global Warming Trends**
- **Techniques:** ARMA models, Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA)
- **Tools:** R
- **Summary:** Forecasted global temperature anomalies using NOAA data. Evaluated model performance using RMSE and the Diebold-Mariano test to compare predictive accuracy between methods.

### 2. **Paper Helicopter Flight Time Optimization**
- **Design:** Randomized block experiment with 2Â² factorial design
- **Summary:** Analyzed the impact of wing dimensions on paper helicopter flight time while controlling for environmental variability to identify the optimal configuration.

### 3. **Monte Carlo Simulation on Odds Ratio Confidence Intervals**
- **Simulation:** 10,000 trials across 2,352 parameter sets
- **Summary:** Evaluated the reliability and small-sample performance of Woolfâ€™s, Gartâ€™s, and Agrestiâ€™s odds ratio confidence intervals, including Welchâ€™s correction.

### 4. **Efficiency of Healthcare Systems During COVID-19**
- **Method:** Non-parametric analysis using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA)
- **Summary:** Assessed the relative efficiency of 13 countriesâ€™ healthcare systems in handling the COVID-19 pandemic, based on published performance metrics.

### 5. **Medical Insurance Premium Prediction**
- **Techniques:** Best subset selection, linear regression, regression trees
- **Summary:** Analyzed a dataset of 1,000 insurance customers to identify key factors influencing premium costs and build predictive models for pricing analysis.



## ðŸ§ª Work in Progress
 
### 1. **Fraud Detection in Financial Transactions**  
Designing a machine learning pipeline to detect suspicious activity in financial transaction data using techniques like Isolation Forest, Logistic Regression, and Autoencoders.
This project involves working with imbalanced data, performance metrics beyond accuracy (e.g., precision, recall, AUC), and real-time anomaly detection strategies.

### 2. **Enhancing Climate Forecast Models**  
Building upon my previous work forecasting global temperature anomalies using ARMA and SSA. To improve predictive accuracy and interpretability, I am incorporating external
explanatory variables such as COâ‚‚ levels, solar radiation, and volcanic activity using regression with ARMA errors (ARIMAX). This extension will provide a more holistic 
understanding of the drivers of global warming.

### 3. **Deep Learning Exploration**  
I recently invested in an NVIDIA graphics card to enable GPU-accelerated computing, and I am currently diving into deep learning. My focus is on building foundational skills 
in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for time-series forecasting. Projects will explore applications in computer vision, medical diagnostics, and natural language processing.
